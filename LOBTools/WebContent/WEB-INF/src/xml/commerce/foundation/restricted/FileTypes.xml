		<p>cmc/foundation/FileTypes defines which files the {@link cmc/foundation/PropertyFileUploader file upload widget} or the {@link cmc/foundation/CustomSerivce} will allow by identifying
		 a set of Windows file extensions. </p>
		
		<p>A set of cmc/foundation/FileTypes can be defined under an object definition whose {@link cmc/foundation/ObjectDefinition#isFileObject isFileObject} 
		attribute is set to true. It can also be defined under a custom service whose (@link cmc/foundation/CustomService#isFileUploadService isFileUploadService} is set 
		to true.</p>  
		
		<p>If there are no cmc/foundation/FileTypes for a file object definition or custom service then the file upload widget will allow all files to be uploaded.</p>		
		
		<p>To specify a file type, define the following required attributes: 
		<ul>
			<li><code>description</code> - the description for the file types defined by this cmc/foundation/FileTypes instance. This string will be used to 
			describe the file types permitted when browsing in the file selection dialog.
			
			<li><code>extension</code> - the Windows file extensions for the file types that this cmc/foundation/FileTypes instance represents. 
			The value of this attribute must be a semicolon-delimited list of Windows file extensions, with a wildcard character (*) 
			preceding each extension. The list of extensions is not actually displayed in the dialog box. To display the list of 
			extensions for the user, they must be included as part of the description
		</ul>
		
		<p>Example:
			@START_CODE
			<FileTypes 
				description="Images"
				extension="*.jpg;*.gif;*.png"/>
			@END_CODE
		</ul>
