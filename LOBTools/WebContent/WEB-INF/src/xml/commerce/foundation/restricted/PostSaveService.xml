		<p>A post save service is a service that is triggered automatically after an object is {@link cmc/foundation/UpdateService saved} 
		or {@link cmc/foundation/CreateService created} successfully. It is not triggered at any other time. 
		
		<p>This service might be used to trigger an action or do clean up work on the server. For example, 
		activation of Customer Segments is modeled as a post save service so that customer segments are activated automatically when they are 
		saved. This means that the business user does not have to understand the concept of having active and inactive customer segments. 
		
		<p>The post save service can be only be declared as a child of a {@link cmc/foundation/PrimaryObjectDefinition primary object definition}. An instance of
		{@link cmc/foundation/ServiceParam}	should be declared as a child of this service for each parameter the service requires be passed in. 
		
		<p>If the post save service executes without exception, the user will see the same message that would be seen upon success of the 
		{@link cmc/foundation/CreateService create} or {@link cmc/foundation/UpdateService update} services in the message console. If the post save service call fails, the error message 
		returned by the URL displays in the message logger and the object will stay dirty even if the save or create was successful. When the 
		object is saved again this service will be called. 		

		<p>The following example demonstrates the declaration of a post save service.
		The service includes one explicitly declared service parameter that sends
		a parameter called "customerSegmentName". The parameter value is retrieved from the
		object property named "customerSegmentName". 
			
		@START_CODE
		<PostSaveService url="/cmc/ActivateCustomerSegment">
			<ServiceParam name="customerSegmentName" propertyName="customerSegmentName"/>
		</PostSaveService>
		@END_CODE
		
		<p>The successful response from a post save service must be an XML document
		that has "object" as the name of the root element. If the response document includes
		properties, then the properties will be applied to the client side representation
		of the business object.  Post save services do not typically need to return
		updated property values. A property is only required if	the post save service causes a change 
		to the value of one	of the object properties. The following sample demonstrates the expected format
		for a successful response. It includes an updated value for the property named
		"active".
			
		@START_CODE
		<object>
			<active>true</active>
		</object>
		@END_CODE
		
		<p>If the request is not successful, then the response must be an XML document
		that has "errors" as the name of the root element. For 
		more information on "errors" and their usages including examples, refer to the documentation for 
		{@link cmc/foundation/UpdateService}.
