		<p>This is used to instantiate the {@link cmc/promotion/BasePromotionCodeUtil code utility} class with an id of "proCodeUtil".
		The instantiated class contains the implementation to generate promotion code example and to calculate the 
		maximum possible number of promotion codes based on a pattern definition. 
		</p>
		<p>The values of the attributes defined in the {@link cmc/promotion/BasePromotionCodeUtil code utility} class may be overridden with 
		custom values. For example, the attribute "valuesForCharacterA" has its value set to "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ".
		This may be replaced with a custom value to possibly omit certain characters in promotion code 
		example generation.
