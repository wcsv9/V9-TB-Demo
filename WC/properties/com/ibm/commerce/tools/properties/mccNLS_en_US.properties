paragraph2=When you logged on, you selected the store and language with which you want to work. If you are assigned a role with fulfillment duties, you also chose the fulfillment center associated with the store. At any time, if you wish to change your store, language, or fulfillment center selection, click the store icon in the top left corner to display the selection dialog.
paragraph3=The WebSphere Commerce Accelerator also tracks the pages you have visited as you complete a task from each menu. This is displayed in the upper right of the WebSphere Commerce Accelerator. The <b>Home</b>, <b>Logout</b>, and current page links always display in the trail, but the items in between may be progressively removed and replaced by ellipses to accommodate the history display area. To return to an earlier point in the task, click the corresponding link. When you select a menu option or click an action button in the WebSphere Commerce Accelerator, a progress indicator displays. Once the action is complete, the trail is updated to display the appropriate page name.
