paragraph1=Define at least one shipping jurisdiction. Shipping jurisdictions are geographical regions or zones representing a country or region, province or territory, or zip code range, to which you sell goods.
paragraph2=Define at least one shipping mode. A shipping mode is the combination of the shipping carrier (the company that provides shipping services from a fulfillment center to a customer) and the shipping service offered by that carrier. For example, ABC Shipping Company, Overnight service and ABC Shipping Company, Express delivery are both shipping modes.
paragraph3=Define shipping codes and assign them to products or categories. Shipping codes indicate how shipping charges are calculated for the products you sell. In order to calculate shipping charges on the products in an order, you must assign shipping codes to products, or categories of products.
