				<!-- 
				
					When rule-based sales categories are enabled (evaluationEnabled="true"), business users can create sales categories using search criteria (rules).  
					When a user saves a rule-based sales category, a  search query  executes and the resulting catalog entries are assigned to the category. The 
					relationships between the catalog entries and the category are stored in the CATGPENREL table, similar to when business users manually assign catalog 
					entries to categories.  After assigning the catalog entries, a search index rebuild is triggered.  Business users can reapply any rule whenever they 
					choose. Reapplying the rule updates the CATGPENREL table records based on the contents of the search index when the rule is reapplied.
					
					The frequency that the rules are automatically reapplied depends on the value of "evaluationTimeInterval".  This value indicates the minimum number 
					of seconds between subsequent evaluations of the rules.  When the value is set to -1, rules are not automatically reapplied except when the job is 
					explicitly called to reapply rules at the completion of  task group approvals and di-buildindex jobs.  When the value is set to a positive number, the 
					job executes at the conclusion of each index build operation, and if the minimum evaluation interval has passed, the rule is re-evaluated.  When 
					the value is  set to a positive number, this job also executes at the completion of task group approvals and di-buildindex jobs. The time interval 
					is ignored when a user reapplies a rule from management center, meaning, the rule is evaluated right away.
					
					When rule-based sales categories are not enabled,  business users see an error message when they attempt to create a rule-based sales category. 
					This message informs the users that rule-based sales categories are not enabled. Set evaluationEnabled  to "true" to enable rule-based sales categories, 
					and set the evaluationTimeInterval to an appropriate value.
					
					Rule-based sales categories can be created only as child categories. Rule-based sales categories cannot contain child categories.
					
					See the associated online documentation for additional details.
					
					NOTES:
						The following property can be adjusted by changing the configured value, then refreshing the registry 'RuleBasedCategoryConfiguration' in the 
						administration console.
							
						The job to apply or reapply rules does not execute on a production instance so that database key collisions can be avoided.  The determination 
						of whether the instance is a production instance is based on whether workspaces or staging are enabled in wc-server.xml.
					
						The default value for this setting is "false".
				
				-->
				<_config:property name="evaluationEnabled" value="false" />
				
				<!-- 
				
					The following property ensures that the job to determine and save rule-based sales category child catalog entries is only run on one node (host).
					
					This is an optional setting that should be set after instance creation and a server is designated as the server where the job is to run.
										
					Consider setting a value for this property if you want to isolate the rule evaluation of rule-based sales categories from other running processes.
										
					NOTES: 
						The host name must be the fully qualified host name.
					
						The default value for this setting is the empty string, indicating that the job can be executed on any host.

				<_config:property name="evaluationHostname" value="" />	
				
				<!-- 
				
					The following property indicates the time interval between rule evaluations by the scheduled job 'EvaluateRuleBasedCategories' for the categories in 
					the CATGRPRULE table.  This job is  called by the search indexing job 'UpdateSearchIndex' after a successful indexing operation.  Since the 
					'EvaluateRuleBasedCategories' job might need to process a large number of rules and catalog entry relationships, consider any potential performance 
					impact when you are setting the value for this property.
										
					The value is in seconds.  When the value is -1, rules are not automatically executed. Business users can manually reapply rules individually whenever 
					they choose.
										
					To have rules automatically reapplied instead of applying them only manually, set this value to a positive number.  Ensure that the timing interval 
					you set does not reapply rules too frequently so the rules are re-evaluated needlessly, but does reapply rules frequently enough to accommodate 
					business user needs.
						
					The default value is "-1".
