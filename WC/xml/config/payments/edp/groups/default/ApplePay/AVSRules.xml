  This file determines what the event-driven payments responses should be when AVS scores 0 to 4 are 
  received for credit card payment methods.
  
  The ScoreRule element maps the payment plug-in responses for AVS scores, as per the payment plug-in 
  specification. The response values can be changed if the defaults (as shown) are not compatible with 
  merchant policies for AVS. 
  
  from:        The AVS response code returned by payment plug-in
  to:          The common AVS response code in WebSphere Commerce:
               0: Both street address and zip code match. 
               1: Street address matches, but zip code does not. 
               2: Zip code matches, but street address does not. 
               3: Neither street address nor zip code match. 
               4: AVS result not available. 
  response:    Specifies what the event-driven payments response should be when that particular AVS score
               is received. This attribute is the only configurable part of this file. Type Pass, 
               AttentionRequired, or Reject as appropriate.
