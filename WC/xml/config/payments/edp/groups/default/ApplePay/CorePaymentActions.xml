  This file defines the core behavior of payment actions executed for event-driven payments. 
  It defines how the required target state of the payment is achieved in terms of actual payment 
  actions defined by the payment back-end system. Possible payment actions are: Approve, Deposit, 
  ReverseApproval, Credit, ConsumeAmount, and Error. However, the valid target states that can be 
  defined in payment actions are: DNE (does not exist), APPROVED, and DEPOSITED.
  
  TargetDNE:       The target state is DNE. 
  TargetApproved:  The target state is APPORVED.
  TargetDeposited: The target state is DEPOSITED.
  
  The markup within each of these elements defines the action that should be taken to move the payment 
  object from its current state to the target state when the current state of the payment is one of 
  the following states: DNE, APPROVED, or DEPOSITED.
  
  CurrentDNE:       The current state is DNE.
  CurrentApproved:  The current state is APPROVED.
  CurrentDeposited: The current state is DEPOSITED.
  
  For each pair of current state and target state, the amount of the payment and the amount of the payment
  requested are used to determine the payment actions:
  
  AmountLessThanRequested:    The amount of the payment is less than the payment requested.
  AmountEqualsRequested:      The amount of the payment equals to the payment requested.
  AmountGreaterThanRequested: The amount of the payment is greater than the payment requested.
  
  The following informations are defined for each payment action:
  name:   The name of the payment action. Possible values are: 
          Approve - Approves the payment. 
          ReverseApproval - Reverses the payment approval. 
          Deposit - Deposits the payment. 
          Credit - Refunds the payment. 
          ConsumeAmount - Updates information internally in WebSphere Commerce but does not perform any 
                          direct payment action with a payment back-end system. For example, ConsumeAmount
                          can be used to update information about a credit card expiry date. An update 
                          is always performed if a payment action is defined. 
          Error - Generates an error. 
  msg:    This parameter is used when the Action name="Error" and holds the actual text of the error message. 
  amount: When the amount of the payment is being processed, it is either: 
          The same as the amount currently known by the system (existing) 
          Different from the current amount (delta) 
          The same as the payment amount requested (requested) 
          Possible values for the amount attribute are: delta, requested, existing. 
  target: Specifies the target payment object for the action. Possible values are for the target attribute are: 
          new - A new payment object should be created and data should be written to the database. 
          additional - An additional operation is expected to follow. Data is kept in memory but is not 
                       written to the database. 
          existing - The payment is the same amount currently expected by the system.
