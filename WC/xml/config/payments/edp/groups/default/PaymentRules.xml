  This is a read-only file used to configure the payment rules for a store or store group. You should not 
  attempt to change this file.
  
  Each entry defines the desired target state for the relevant payment amount for each of the business 
  events for an order: 
    PrimePaymentEvent:    Applies to the order capture business event (when the customer clicks the Buy 
                          button)
    ReservePaymentEvent:  Applies to the release to fulfillment business event (when the order is released
                          to a warehouse or some other entity for fulfillment)
    FinalizePaymentEvent: Applies to the fulfillment business event (when the order is filled and items 
                          are boxed and shipped) 
  The relevant amount is the amount being processed in each business event. 
    For PrimePaymentEvent, the relevant amount is the amount of goods available in stock during order capture. 
    For ReservePaymentEvent, the relevant amount is the total amount of the releases involved in the particular
                             release to fulfillment. 
    For FinalizePaymentEvent, the relevant amount is the amount of the release being fulfilled. 
    
  The basic assumption is that amounts can be approved (APPROVED) and deposited (DEPOSITED). If an amount does 
  not need to be approved or deposited, the target state is DNE (does not exist), meaning the amount does not 
  yet exist as a payment transaction. 

  The following parameters affect the behavior of event-driven payments. 

  name:        The name of the payment rule (for example, Early Validation). 
  targetState: The target state a payment should be in under that payment rule for each business event 
               (primePayment, reservePayment, and finalizePayment). The targetState in each payment action rule
               conforms to these restrictions:
                  The targetState values are uppercase. 
                  The targetState for FinalizePaymentEvent is DEPOSITED to complete the payment action rule. 
                  The targetState for a phase is the same as the previous phase or more restrictive. The order
                  of restriction is: DNE, APPROVED, DEPOSITED.
