    <complexType name="GSMModemConfiguration">
        <annotation>
        	<documentation>Describes the configuration of an SMS modem. The configuration specifes basic operating parameters such as whether to store and/or delete incoming messages as they are received on the modem.
The configuration also specifies a number of status check parameters, such as how often to check whether the modem is physically operating, how often to check that the user account (the mobile
telephone number being used) is valid, and how often to check the signal strength. Additional parameters define what signal strength redings should be considered high and low (these readings are
in general a very modem-specific value). The modem configuration also specifies a message spacing period, which is the amount of time the modem should "rest" between the transmission of outgoing messages.</documentation>
