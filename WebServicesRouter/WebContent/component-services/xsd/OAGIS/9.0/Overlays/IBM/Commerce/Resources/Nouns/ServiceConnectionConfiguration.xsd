This parameter is the size of the retry period. A zero or small value indicates constant and intensive immediate retries of a broken data service connection and is not recommended.
A negative value indicates no retries are attempted at all. A typical setting is 30000 (30 seconds).</documentation>

                	<documentation>Maximum times per retry period a failed connection attempt is repeated. The general purpose of this parameter is to limit thrashing (unbounded flurries of failed connect attempts).
A zero or negative value indicates no retries are attempted at all. A typical setting is 1. Note that this generally means there is one attempt per retry period and the retry period is
simply the spacing between those attempts. However, in some cases the application may wish to "double check" these attempts by allowing 2 or more retries during each retry period.
In this case this parameter may be increased.</documentation>
